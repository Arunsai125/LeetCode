# 📘 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Repository**!  
This repo automatically syncs my solutions from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/ArunSaiNarla/) using [LeetHub v2](https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0).  
It contains problems I've solved across various topics including algorithms, data structures, and system design.

---

## 📌 Repository Structure

Each folder typically follows this format:
📁 Topic_Name/ 📄 Problem_Name.java

The filenames are consistent with the LeetCode problem titles for easy search and reference.  
All submissions include the exact code submitted on LeetCode.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- 🧠 Track progress on daily coding
- 📈 Improve problem-solving skills
- 📝 Create a searchable, version-controlled archive of solved problems
- 💼 Showcase consistent learning effort to recruiters and peers

---

## 📊 Stats & Highlights

- 🔁 Synced using **LeetHub v2**
- ✅ Regular updates based on solved problems
- 📚 Covers multiple categories: Array, Graph, DP, Tree, String, and more
- 🌱 Language used: Mainly **Java**, with occasional **Python** and **C++**

## 📣 How It Works

This repo uses [LeetHub v2](https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0) Chrome extension which:
1. Detects LeetCode submissions
2. Automatically creates or updates the corresponding GitHub file
3. Syncs the solution, problem name, and description (if enabled)
